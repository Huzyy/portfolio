        <p style="margin-top:5%">
            Like many other technology innovations, the touchscreen has become a major part of our everyday lives. There are two main types: capacitive and resistive touchscreens. Resistive touchscreens are used in ATMs and work by using 2 layers that are marginally apart. When you push the top layer into the bottom layer, you interrupt the small charge underneath the screen and a processor
            is able to interpret where the charge was interrupted and change the screen. For capacitive touchscreens, there is also a small charge but it is much closer to the screen, so just tapping the screen with your finger or any conductor will distort the electric field in the screen. A much more advanced processor interprets where on the screen the charge was disrupted, and this could 
            be in multiple places at one time, which allows for multiple finger gestures to be used such as the zooming in and out functions that are available on modern phones.
        </p>
        <p><br>Touchscreens are great for reducing the size of our devices and making them more accessible, which reduces the need for external mouse and keyboard devices. The majority of people use touchscreens during the day, and they are often the last thing they see before they go to bed. We spend hours of our day tapping and scrolling on various devices using a touchscreen, but do we really know how they work?
        </p>
        <p><br>Although touchscreens are available in a variety of technologies, they all serve the same purpose; sending precise electrical signals from specific locations on the screen. You may have tried lightly touching the screen of an old navigation device or an ATM and realized it hadn't registered your touch, however your smartphone will respond immediately after you lightly touch it. This is an instance 
            where we can reflect on how fast the technology for touchscreens has advanced, just decades after it became a mass-produced item. 
        </p>
        <p><br>The reason why older devices don't respond when you tap them is because they have resistive touchscreens, these require you to push and bend the screen to get a response. This is because resistive touchscreens require you to use force as opposed to tapping the screen, which is due to the fact that they have 2 layers. A rigid sheet of glass forms the bottom layer, while a flexible yet hard and transparent
            material such as polyethylene (which is used to make the bottles for soft drinks) forms the top layer. In order to allow the screen to work, both of the layers are coated with a thin layer of a metal compound that facilitates the conductivity of electricity. An example of this is indium tin oxide, which is commonly used because it is transparent. In between the 2 layers are spacer dots or spacers which keep the
            screens apart to make sure that there won't be any false touch signals. As the resistive touchscreen is on, a small voltage is applied in both the horizontal and vertical directions, forming a grid of electrical charges across the screen. Pushing the top polyethene layer with your finger or a stylus will connect the two layers together, resulting in a change of voltage and this activates a small processor which 
            is connected to the screen. As the charge is applied in a grid pattern under the screen, the processor can determine specifically which X and Y coordinate on the screen you pushed, and it uses this information to change the screen.
        </p>
        <p><br>Unlike the resistive touchscreen, the capacitive touchscreen doesn't require you to push the screen in order for it to work. Instead, many extremely thin lines of conductive metal are placed under the glass screen. These screens may also use indium tin oxide as a conductor. These lines are arranged in a grid shape, like they are in resistive touchscreens but in capacitive touchscreens the grid is much more accurate
            due to the thin lines of metal used. A capacitive touchscreen also generates a small electric current, but only on the vertical (driving) lines since the horizontal (sensing) lines are used to detect the current at all times. These touchscreens also use a processor; however, this processor works differently. It measures the current at all of the points where the driving and sensing lines overlap in order to calculate
            the base electrostatic charge. The current across the screen doesn't change from the base charge unless something conductive, like your finger or a special stylus comes into contact with the screen. Our bodies have atoms that are both positively and negatively charged, which allows us to conduct electricity. Due to our ability to conduct electricity, our fingers will cause a distortion in the electric field of the
            screen when we touch it. The distortion is caused by our fingers making a complete circuit when in contact with the screen, and this distortion will be picked up by a processor, allowing the gesture you made to be immediately interpreted. 
        </p>
        <p><br>Touchscreens are widely used in almost every field in our society. Security firms, shopping centres, education, medical healthcare, businesses, banking, industrial and the police are just a few examples of where they are used, and you may even be using a touchscreen as you read this. In fact, the touchpad on modern day laptops have also been designed with the same technology as touchscreens, capacitive touch, 
            the only difference is that they do not have a screen behind them. Technology is continually improving, which is lowering the price of touchscreens and allowing more people to purchase them.  Yet few people really understand how this technology works, or how far this industry has come.
