        <h2 style="color: #00ff41;padding-left: 4ch;">Stage 1 - Passive Reconnaissance Report</h2>

        <p><em style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">Note: The findings have been removed from this report to protect the target's sensitive data and abide by UK GDPR. Only the recommendations are listed below.</em> <br>
            <br>During the reconnaissance of the target company I was able to find IP addresses, mail servers, email addresses, host domains and domain registrar information using only OSINT sources. I also found potential vulnerabilities via various OSINT sources on the public domain, including DNS, emails, and website configurations.
        <br> The complete report highlights sensitive information that was found, including as IP addresses, company emails & page paths that can be used by attackers with malicious intent and informs the target company of the measures that should be taken to ensure that this information is kept secure and out of the public domain. This includes access controls, robust authentication and session management, encryption, security audits and other security practices to ensure protection from network penetration.
            <br> I have taken measures to ensure that all the information gathered is from the public domain and is therefore legal to seek. The integrity of penetration testing has been maintained, with a commitment to ethical and legal practices by consulting with an ethics and legal department, ensuring that all data collected is within the scope of the reconnaissance phase of penetration testing.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">Google Dorking:</h2>
        <p>Google dorks were used to access publicly available information that everyday users of the internet may stumble upon when using search engines; the company has good security measures in place to ensure that attackers are unable to find sensitive information, such as login credentials & user data. Directory structures and sensitive files are hidden from google dorks which ensures that they remain confidential and that the threat of unauthorised access is reduced.

            The employees administrating the company help pages and forums must ensure that all questions are manually approved or filtered to eliminate the threat of sensitive information being posted. Developer pages must be password protected to ensure that information regarding the network’s security can only be shared with existing and approved users, instead of on a page that is easily accessible to the public as it currently is.  </p>

        <h2 style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">NS lookup:</h2>
        <p>NSlookup was used to acquire information about the target company’s website. The results showed that IPv4, mail servers and txt records can be found via passive reconnaissance. Therefore, in order to maintain security standards, the company must perform regular monitoring including security audits as well as implement multifactor authentication to enhance security and ensure security against unauthorized access.  </p>

        <h2 style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">The Harvester:</h2>
        <p>Using theHarvester tool to query the most popular search engines returned the hosts on the company's network as well as  inbound email addresses used and monitored by employees. The discovery of these hosts can be used by attackers to map out and understand the company’s digital infrastructure – network mapping. Attackers can find vulnerabilities associated with these hosts to launch a targeted attack against the company. The company email addresses can also be targeted by phishing attacks, leading to consequences such as malware distribution and ransomware attacks.

            <br>Network segmentation and initializing the use of access controls will isolate potentially vulnerable sites within the domain from potential hackers, adding additional levels of security. Robust email filtering and educating sales employees about the cybersecurity risks within emails will also reduce the risks of network penetration.  </p>

        <h2 style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">WHOIS:</h2>
        <p>The results from WHOIS show that the domain is managed by [domain management team] who have exceptional security standards, making it exceptionally difficult for most hackers to breach. PII and sensitive information have been redacted, with a prompt including completing a multistep process before information can be requested from [domain management team].

            Brief location information about the name servers is available, however searching up other domains registered by the company may result in more information being publicly accessible, as was the case with searching [company domain]. The company must ensure that [domain management team] keeps the same restrictions on all information regarding the domains, across all domains. Registrar locks are in place to ensure that the domain is unable to be hijacked, however the name servers should be redacted, and DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) should be put in place.  </p>

        <h2 style="color: #008F11; padding-top: 5%">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The complete Passive Reconnaissance document highlights various aspects of cybersecurity risks and potential malicious activities attackers can carry out with the information that the company shares on the public domain. From DNS vulnerabilities and email security threats to mapping out website configurations and the absence of multi-factor authorisation, it's evident that the company must act to ensure that their digital assets are secure. The impacts of findings detailed in this report such as page paths, IP addresses & email address underscore the importance of robust security measures. It is recommended that the company implements practices such as regular security audits, user education, and vulnerability mitigation to fortify against potential exploitation. </p>
